    <h2>A - E</h2>

    <dl>
        <dt>Ablative absolute</dt>
        <dd>A phrase which is independent of any grammatical constraints of the main sentence which it is linked to, and contains a participle in the ablative case.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Ablative of comparison</dt>
        <dd>Sometimes the ablative form of a noun or pronoun is used in sentences to denote comparison instead of the word <em class="latin">'quam'</em>.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Active voice</dt>
        <dd>This is the form of the verb we use when someone or something has carried out an action. We use this voice to say what the subject does.<br /><br />
            For example: <em>Cartam confirmat</em>He confirms the charter. </dd>
    </dl>


    <dl>
        <dt><</a>Accusative and infinitive clause</dt>
        <dd>A clause that appears after the main verb, which uses a noun in the accusative and the infinitive form of the verb in its construction, such as in the sentence 'he said that he would perform the service'. This is called an indirect statement in English.<br />
            <br />
            For example: <em>Credo <strong>Johannem dedisse</strong> Matheo terram</em>. (Literally - I believe John to have given to Matthew the land.) I believe that John has given the land to Matthew.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Adjective </dt>
        <dd>An adjective is the type of word which we use to describe a noun.<br />
            <br />
            For example: A <strong>handsome</strong> man</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Adverb</dt>
        <dd>An adverb is the type of word which we use to describe a verb.<br />
            <br />For example: He ran <strong>quickly</strong>.</dd>
    </dl>


    <div class="topofpage"><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></div>

    <dl>
        <dt>Case</dt>
        <dd>A case is the particular form a noun, adjective or pronoun takes, that shows its relationship with other words in the sentence. There are six cases in Latin - the nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive, dative and ablative - and these exist in the singular and plural.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Comparative</dt>
        <dd>When we compare two things, we use the comparative form of an adjective to express which person or thing has a greater or lesser property or quality than the other. <br />
            <br />
            For example: He is <strong>taller</strong> than her.<br />
            <br />


            When we compare two actions or states, we use the comparative form of an adverb to express which action or state has a greater or lesser property or quality than the other.<br />
            <br />


            For example: He ran more <strong>quickly</strong>.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Complement</dt>
        <dd>In the majority of sentences you will find a subject and an object. However, sometimes you will come across a sentence which contains no object such as this:<br />
            <br />
            <strong>He<sup>1</sup></strong> is the new <strong>farmer<sup>2</sup></strong><br />
            <br />

            <sup>1</sup>Subject (Nominative)<br />
            <sup>2</sup>Complement (Nominative)<br />
            <br />
            In this case, 'he'; is the subject and 'farmer' is the complement. 'Farmer' is an extra piece of information about 'he', thus both subject and complement appear in the nominative case.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Compound verbs</dt>
        <dd>In Latin, prepositions can be added to the beginning of simple verbs in order to modify their meaning.<br />
            <br />
            For example: <em><strong>ab</strong>sum, <strong>ab</strong>esse, <strong>a</strong>fui</em>to be away from, absent, lacking</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt></a>Conjugation</dt>
        <dd>Latin verbs are divided into four groups, or conjugations. In each conjugation, the verbs share the same endings.<br />

            An example of a first conjugation verb is: <em>confirmo, confirmare, confirmavi, confirmatum</em> (1)  to confirm.<br />

            An example of a second conjugation verb is: <em>habeo, habere, habui, habitum</em> (2)  to have.<br />

            An example of a third conjugation verb is: <em>duco, ducere, duxi, ductum</em> (3) to lead.<br />

            An example of a fourth conjugation verb is: <em>audio, audire, audivi, auditum</em> (4)  to hear.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Dative of possession</dt>
        <dd>Sometimes in a sentence such as 'John is the son of William' the dative case is used to translate 'of William' instead of the genitive.</dd>
    </dl>

    <div class="topofpage"><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></div>

    <dl>
        <dt>Declension</dt>
        <dd>Latin nouns are divided into five groups called declensions.  In each declension, the nouns share the same endings. A declension is usually defined by its ending in the nominative singular.  For example, nouns in the first declension end '-<em>a</em>' in the nominative singular. If a declension has a variety of forms in the nominative singular, it will be defined by its endings in the genitive singular. For example, nouns in the third declension end '-<em>is</em>' in the genitive singular. </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Demonstrative adjective</dt>
        <dd>Demonstrative adjectives include 'this', 'these', 'that' and 'those' and are used to identify a particular noun or noun phrase. <br />
            <br />
            For example: I gave <strong>these</strong> sweets to <strong>that</strong> boy.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Deponent verb</dt>
        <dd>When a Latin verb is passive in form, but has an active meaning, it is called a deponent verb.<br />
            <br />
            For example: <em>sequor, sequi, secutus sum</em> (3) means 'to follow' and not 'to be followed'.</dd>
    </dl>

    <div><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></div>

    <h2>F - L</h2>

    <dl>
        <dt>Future participle</dt>
        <dd>The future participle is used for actions that will be completed in the future and is often used with the verb 'to be'.<br />
            <br />
            For example: I am about to finish.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Future perfect tense</dt>
        <dd>The future perfect tense is used to describe actions that will be completed before a definite time in the future. <br />
            <br />
            For example: I will have finished.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Future simple tense</dt>
        <dd>The future simple tense is used to describe actions that will be completed in the future.<br />
            <br />
            For example: I will arrive.</dd>
    </dl>

    <div class="topofpage"><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></div>

    <dl>
        <dt>Genitive of value</dt>
        <dd>Sometimes the genitive form of a noun is used to denote value instead of using a phrase such as 'to the value of'.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Gerund</dt>
        <dd>A gerund is a verbal noun or a noun that derives its form from a verb. It functions as a noun, but retains some characteristics of the verb. It is usually translated with the ending 'ing'.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Gerundive</dt>
        <dd>A gerundive is a verbal adjective or an adjective that derives its form from a verb. It functions as an adjective, and it is usually translated with the ending 'ing'</dd>
    </dl>

    <div class="topofpage"><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></div>

    <dl>
        <dt>Imperfect tense</dt>
        <dd>The imperfect tense is used to show action going on in the past over a period of time or frequently. It should be translated into English using the words 'was' or 'used to'.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Impersonal verb</dt>
        <dd>This is a verb that has only 'it' as the subject.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Indefinite pronoun</dt>
        <dd>This is a pronoun that does not refer to a specific person or thing.<br />
            <br />
            For example: 'anything' or 'anybody'</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Infinitive</dt>
        <dd>The infinitive form of a verb is that which has no inflection to indicate person or number. In English the infinitive of a verb begins 'to â€¦'. To make other forms of a verb it is important to know the present infinitive of verbs, which is listed second in a dictionary, with the ending '-<em>are</em>', '-<em>ere</em>' or '-<em >ire</em>'. <br />
            <br />
            For example: <em>habeo, <strong>habere</strong>, habui, habitum</em><br />
            <br />
            In total, there are six infinitives for most verbs, the active present, perfect and future and the passive present, perfect and future.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Inflection</dt>
        <dd>Many types of Latin words change, principally in their endings, to reflect a grammatical link between themselves and other words in a sentence. These changes are called inflections.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Irregular</dt>
        <dd>A verb or noun that does not follow the normal patterns of conjugation or declension.</dd>
    </dl>

    <div class="topofpage"><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></div>

    <h2>M - R</h2>

    <dl>
        <dt>Mood</dt>
        <dd>Three moods of a verb exist in Latin. <br />
            <br />
            The <strong>indicative</strong> mood expresses facts. <br />

            The <strong>imperative</strong> mood expresses commands.<br />

            The <strong>subjunctive</strong> expresses an element of uncertainty, often a wish, desire, doubt or hope.<br />
            <br />
            For example:<br />

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>I am happy</td>
                    <td><strong>Indicative</strong></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Be happy</td>
                    <td><strong>Imperative</strong></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>I wish I were happy</td>
                    <td><strong>Subjunctive</strong></td>
                </tr>
            </table></dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Noun</dt>
        <dd>A noun is a person, place or thing.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Object</dt>
        <dd>The object of a sentence is the recipient of the action carried out in a sentence. <br />
            <br />
            For example: John hit the <strong>ball</strong>.</dd>
    </dl>

    <div><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></div>

    <dl>
        <dt>Participle</dt>
        <dd>A participle is formed from a verb but looks and behaves like an adjective. This means that it agrees with the noun it modifies in number, case and gender.<br />
            <br />
            In Latin three kinds of participle exist: the present, perfect and future.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Passive voice</dt>
        <dd>This is the form of the verb we use when an action is done to the subject of a sentence. We use this voice to say what happens to the subject.<br />
            <br />
            For example: <em>Carta confirmatur</em> The charter is confirmed. </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Past participle</dt>
        <dd>A past participle is used with the verb 'to be' to indicate an action that is complete.<br />
            <br />
            For example: I am finished.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Past tense</dt>
        <dd>In Latin there are three past tenses - the imperfect, perfect and pluperfect - and they are all used to talk about actions or states which took place before now.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Perfect tense</dt>
        <dd>The perfect tense is used to describe a simple completed action in the past.<br />
            <br />
            For example: I wrote a letter.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Person</dt>
        <dd>There are three persons in grammar and these exist in the singular and plural:<br />
            <br />

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>First person singular (I)</td>
                    <td>First person plural (we)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Second person singular (you)	</td>
                    <td>Second person plural (you)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Third person singular (he/she/it)</td>
                    <td>Third person plural (they)</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Personal pronouns</dt>
        <dd>Personal pronouns, such as 'I', 'you', 'he', 'she', 'it', 'we' and 'they', are used as a substitute for the names of people or things.<br />
            <br />
            For example: <strong>I</strong> looked at <strong>it</strong>.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Pluperfect tense</dt>
        <dd>The pluperfect tense (or past perfect in English) is used to describe finished actions that have been completed at a definite point in time in the past. It is easiest to understand it as a past 'past' action.<br />
            <br />
            For example: I had givenâ€¦</dd>
    </dl>

    <div class="topofpage"><a href="#top">Top of Page</a></div>

    <dl>

    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Preposition</dt>
        <dd>A preposition is a word which indicates the grammatical relationship between other words in a sentence.  In this way, it is similar to an inflection. <br />
            <br />For example: <em><strong>Ante</strong> meridiem</em><strong>Before</strong> midday</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Present participle</dt>
        <dd>A present participle is used with the verb 'to be' to indicate an action that is incomplete. <br />
            <br />
            For example: I am reading.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Present tense</dt>
        <dd>The present tense is used to describe actions or states which are taking place now.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt>Principal part</dt>
        <dd>When you look up a verb in a Latin dictionary you are normally presented with four principal parts. From these, you are able to work out the various forms of the verb.<br />
            <br />
            For example:
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th></th>
                    <th>Present<br />

                    <th>Present infinitive</th>
                    <th>Perfect active<br />
                        (1<sup>st</sup> person)</th>
                    <th>Supine</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th><em>habere</em><br />
                        to have</th>
                    <td ><em>habeo</em></td>
                    <td ><em>habere</em></td>
                    <td ><em>habui</em></td>
