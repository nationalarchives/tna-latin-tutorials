<p>This is an introduction to the problems that you may encounter with Latin vocabulary and grammar in documents from the period 1086 to 1733.
</p>
<p>It is important to remember that the Latin used in the period covered by this tutorial was
	<strong>not consistent
	</strong>. As a living language, its vocabulary, meanings and grammar changed over time.
</p>
<p>Read through these problems and be aware that you may face any or all of them. However, do not worry about them. In time and with practice, you will find that you can deal with them easily.

	<p>There was no consistent way of spelling even common words in the
		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#medieval">medieval
		</a>,
		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#tudor">Tudor
		</a> or
		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#stuart">Stuart
		</a> periods. Look at the different spellings of these words, meaning grace
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>gratia, –e
		</em>(f.) First
		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#declension">declension

		<em>gracia, –e
		</em> (f.) First
		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#declension">declension
		</a>
	</p>
	<p>Spelling changed over time and varied between individuals. You will often see a word spelt more than one way within a single document.
		<br>
		If you cannot find a word in the dictionary, think about other ways to spell it and try looking these up.
		<br>
		Consider letters that sound similar, like ‘a’ and ‘e’, ‘m’ and ‘n’, ‘c’ and ‘t’.

		</a>
	</p>
	<p>In
		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#medieval">medieval
		</a> documents, many letters are almost indistinguishable, for example
		<br>
		‘c’ and ‘t’
		<br>
		‘u’ and ‘v’
		<br>
		‘i’ and ‘j’
		<br>
		Sometimes it is not possible to differentiate between ‘i’, ‘m’, ‘n’, ‘u’ or ‘v’!
		<br>
		Are you looking at an an unfamiliar word in your document?
		<br>
		Consider whether these interchangeable letters might help you identify it.
		<br>
		For example, could that letter that appears to be a ‘c’ really be a ‘t’?

	<p>Some words have a form from more than one
		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#gender">gender

		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#masculine">masculine

		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#feminine">feminine
		</a> form.
		<br>
		Look at these words, which both mean ‘
		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#park">park

	<p>
		<em>parca, -e

	</p>
	<p>There are many more words with more than one form. It is not possible to provide a comprehensive list.
		<br>
		You can try looking up these forms in R.E. Latham,
		<em>Revised Medieval Latin Word-list
		</em>, (London, published for the British Academy by the Oxford University Press, 1973).
		<br>
		This is the standard and most accessible work, which you should be able to find in most reference libraries.
		<br>
		However,
		<em>Revised Medieval Latin Word-list
		</em> is not definitive and your document may contain a different form of a word. There is also the
		<em>Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British Sources
		</em> (Oxford University Press). This is a substantial and long-term project; in early 2005, only volumes up to the letter ‘O’ have been published.

	<h2>
	<a name="use">
	</a>Use of ‘ae’ instead of ‘e’
	</h2>
	<p>
		<a href="#top">
			Top of page
		</a>
	</p>
	<p>In
		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#tudor">Tudor
		</a> and
		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#stuart">Stuart
		</a> documents, you may notice that some words were spelt with an ‘ae’ instead of an ‘e’.
		<br>
		For example, instead of
		<em>hec
		</em> you might see
		<em>haec
		</em>.
		<br>
		The ‘ae’ spelling was used in the
		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#classical">Classical
		</a> period, but later lapsed. It was taken up again in the
		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#tudor">Tudor
		</a> and
		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#stuart">Stuart
		</a> period.
		<br>
		Be aware that in documents from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, you will find words that are spelt with an ‘ae’ instead of an ‘e’.
		<br>
		Remember this when you are using the word list, where ‘ae’ forms are
		<strong>not
		</strong> given.

	<p>No previous knowledge of Latin is required for this tutorial.
		<br>
		However, if you studied
		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#classical">Classical
		</a> Latin at school, you will find that the Latin in this tutorial is different.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Word order in
			<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#medieval">medieval
			</a> Latin was less strict than in
			<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#classical">Classical
			</a> Latin. For example, medieval Latin verbs are not necessarily at the end of the sentence. You may find documents in which the word order is very similar to English.
		</li>
		<li>There was no consistency of spelling in medieval Latin.
		</li>
		<li>The Classical ‘ae’ form was replaced by ‘e’ in the medieval period.
		</li>
		<li>	There are other changes in spelling, including
			Medieval Latin sometimes changes Classical ‘h’ to ‘ch’. For example,
			<em>mihi
			</em> ‘to me’ becomes
			<em>michi
			</em>.
			Medieval Latin sometimes adds a ‘p’ to Classical words. For example,
			<em>damnum
			</em> ‘damages’ becomes
			<em>dampnum
			</em>.
		</li>
		<li>The meaning of some important words in changed between the
			<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#classical">Classical
			</a> and the
			<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#medieval">medieval
			</a> periods
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		<em>baro, baronis
		</em> (m.)
		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#baron">baron
		</a>,
		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#tenant">tenant-in-chief
		</a>
		<br>
		<em>miles, militis
		</em> (m.)
		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#knight">knight
		</a>
		<br>
		<em>villa, -e
		</em> (f.)
		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#vill">vill
		</a>, town
	</p>
	<p>If you look these up in a
		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#classical">Classical
		</a> Latin dictionary, a different meaning will be given. The meaning will be inappropriate for the
		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#medieval">medieval
		</a>,
		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#tudor">Tudor
		</a> or
		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#stuart">Stuart
		</a> periods.
	</p>
	<p>For example, in Roman times, a
		<em>villa
		</em> was an
		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#agricultural">agricultural
		</a> estate or farm with a large house at the centre.
		<br>
		In the
		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#medieval">medieval
		</a> period, a
		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#vill">vill
		</a> was a small to medium sized settlement or town.
	</p>
	<p>Use reference works
		<strong>designed for medieval Latin
		</strong> to avoid any confusion.
		<br>
		You will find R.E. Latham,
		<em>Revised Medieval Latin Word-list
		</em>, (London, published for the British Academy by the Oxford University Press, 1973) very helpful.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Medieval Latin was influenced by contemporary society and therefore English spellings and words started to appear.
			<br>
			For example, you will often find these words in medieval Latin documents
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		<em>croftum, -i
		</em>(n.)
		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#croft">croft
		</a>
		<br>
		<em>shopa, -e
		</em>(f.) shop
		<br>
		<em>virgata, -e
		</em>(f.)
		<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#virgate">virgate
		</a>
	</p>
	<p>They are English words which have been turned into Latin.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>There is a much greater use of
			<em>quod
			</em> (meaning ‘that’) in medieval Latin. You will often find it after
			<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#verb">verbs
			</a> of saying, thinking, replying, claiming etc.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		<em>dicit quod
		</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he says that
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The increased use of
			<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#preposition">prepositions
			</a> in medieval Latin, particularly
			<em>ad, de
			</em> and
			<em>per
			</em>. In
			<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#classical">Classical
			</a> Latin, the same phrase would be given using the
			<a href="/latin/beginners/popup/glossary/default.htm#noun">noun
			</a> with the appropriate case ending.
		</li>
		<li>In medieval Latin,
			<em>de
			</em> is frequently used to mean ‘of’.
