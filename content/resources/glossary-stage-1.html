				<a name="ablative">
				</a>
				<h2>Ablative
				</h2>
				<p> The sixth of the six cases of a noun. The ablative case is used for nouns that are ‘by, with or from’ something. For example, in the sentence ‘we grant land by a charter’, ‘a charter’ is in the ablative case. Some prepositions are followed by the ablative case.
				</p>
				<a name="accusative">

					<a href="#top">Top

				</p>
				<h2>Active
				</h2>
				<p> With an active verb, the subject of the sentence carries out the action of the verb. For example, in the sentence ‘the king grants the charter’, the king is the subject and he is doing the action of the verb (granting). The opposite of the active is passive, where the subject of the sentence is acted upon by something else. For example, in the sentence ‘the charter was granted’, the charter is the subject and it is being acted upon (granted). Only active verbs are covered in this tutorial.

For example, nouns in the first declension end ‘-a’ in the nominative singular. If a declension has a variety of forms in the nominative singular, it will be defined by its endings in the genitive singular. For example, nouns in the third declension end ‘-is’ in the genitive singular.

				<h2>Domesday Book
				</h2>
				<p> Extensive and detailed survey of land tenure in England made for King William I in 1086. As well as recording who held the land, the survey also noted who was living on it, the livestock they had, the value of the land and the taxes it owed to the Crown. The English people named the survey ‘Domesday’ after the Day of Judgement described in the Bible, when every soul would be judged with no right of appeal. The Domesday Book is the oldest surviving public record in England. It is held at The National Archives.

				<h2>Edward II
				</h2>
				<p> King of England, 1307 – 1327. Son of Edward I and Eleanor of Castile. During Edward’s reign there were serious political tensions between the King, his favourites and those who felt excluded from his court. In 1327, Edward was deposed by a faction led by his wife Isabella and their son and heir, Prince Edward. Prince Edward was subsequently crowned Edward III. Edward II died in prison later in the year.

				<a name="edwardconfessor">
				</a>
				<br>
				<h2>Edward the Confessor, King Edward
				</h2>
				<p> King of England, 1042 – 1066. Son of King Ethelred the Unready and Emma of Normandy. Last of the line of Anglo-Saxon kings of England, Edward had no son and therefore was without an obvious heir. Amongst several possible claimants to the throne, the two most important were William, Duke of Normandy and Harold Godwinson, Earl of Wessex. William claimed that Edward promised him the throne, but it appears that Edward nominated Harold on his deathbed. Harold succeeded Edward in 1066, but later in the year William successfully invaded England and seized the throne. Edward was made a saint in the twelfth century; the centre of his cult was Westminster Abbey.
				</p>
				<a name="edwardmartyr">
				</a>
				<br>
				<h2>Edward the Martyr
				</h2>
				<p> King of England, 975 - 978. Son of King Edgar. Although only 13 years old and probably illegitimate, Edward was the eldest of Edgar’s sons and was therefore chosen by the archbishop of Canterbury to be the next king. After a very brief reign, Edward was murdered by his step-mother, allowing his young step-brother Aethelred to succeed to the throne. Edward’s body was eventually buried at Shaftesbury nunnery; he quickly became venerated as a saint. From the late eleventh or early twelfth century, Edward became known as ‘the Martyr’.

				<p> All Latin nouns have a gender. There are three genders – masculine (for things that are male), feminine (for things that are female) and neuter (for things that are neither masculine nor feminine). Gender in grammar is not the same as gender in sex. In English, few nouns are given a gender, although we describe ships as ‘she’.

				<p> King of England, 1066. Son of Godwin, earl of Wessex and Gytha. When Harold succeeded his father as Earl of Wessex in 1052, he became the most powerful English nobleman. His brother-in-law, King Edward, died childless in 1066 and nominated Harold as his successor. Harold was accepted as king by the English. However, William, Duke of Normandy, believed that he had been promised the throne and invaded England. Harold was killed at the battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066.

				<h2>Parish

				<p> Medieval England was divided into thousands of parishes, each a small area local to and administered by a Catholic church for religious purposes. People within the parish worshipped at the parish church and paid a tenth of their produce, known as a tithe, to the priest or parson at the church. In return, the priest was responsible for their spiritual welfare. After the Reformation, the parishes were taken over by the Church of England. The term parish is also used for an area of civil administration; this may or may not coincide with the ecclesiastical parish.

				<h2>Saint
				</h2>
				<p> After the death of a person considered to have been exceptionally holy, the Church could begin a process of recognising their life, which ultimately ended in their being named as a saint. In medieval England, the Catholic Church controlled this process, deciding which saints could lawfully be recognised and therefore prayed to for aid. Besides being a source of help and possibly of miracles themselves, saints were also a means of obtaining God’s help. Therefore they were an important focus for religious worship and had a major impact on everyday life in the medieval period. Each saint was said to have one or more attributes and had a particular day of the year designated to him or her. Parish churches were dedicated to one or more of the saints.
