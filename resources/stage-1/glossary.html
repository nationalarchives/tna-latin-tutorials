The opposite of the active is passive, where the subject of the sentence is acted upon by something else. For example, in the sentence ‘the charter was granted’, the charter is the subject and it is being acted upon (granted). Only active verbs are covered in this tutorial.</p>

<h2>Court of Common Pleas</h2>
<p> Central royal court, first held in the late 12th century and also known as the Bench. It came to concentrate on civil disputes between individuals, known as pleas. A clause in Magna Carta established that the court should be held in a fixed place, which was normally Westminster.

<h2>Declension</h2>
<p>Latin nouns are divided into five groups called declensions. In each declension, the nouns share the same endings. A declension is usually defined by its ending in the nominative singular. For example, nouns in the first declension end ‘-a’ in the nominative singular. If a declension has a variety of forms in the nominative singular, it will be defined by its endings in the genitive singular. For example, nouns in the third declension end ‘-is’ in the genitive singular.</p>

<h2>Decline</h2>

<h2>Demesne</h2>

The English people named the survey ‘Domesday’ after the Day of Judgement described in the Bible, when every soul would be judged with no right of appeal. The Domesday Book is the oldest surviving public record in England. It is held at The National Archives.</p>

<h2>Edward II</h2>
<p>King of England, 1307 – 1327. Son of Edward I and Eleanor of Castile.

In 1327, Edward was deposed by a faction led by his wife Isabella and their son and heir, Prince Edward. Prince Edward was subsequently crowned Edward III. Edward II died in prison later in the year.</p>

<h2>Edward the Confessor, King Edward</h2>
<p>King of England, 1042 – 1066. Son of King Ethelred the Unready and Emma of Normandy. Last of the line of Anglo-Saxon kings of England, Edward had no son and therefore was without an obvious heir. Amongst several possible claimants to the throne, the two most important were William, Duke of Normandy and Harold Godwinson, Earl of Wessex. William claimed that Edward promised him the throne, but it appears that Edward nominated Harold on his deathbed. Harold succeeded Edward in 1066, but later in the year William successfully invaded England and seized the throne. Edward was made a saint in the twelfth century; the centre of his cult was Westminster Abbey.</p>

<h2>Edward the Martyr</h2>
<p>King of England, 975 - 978. Son of King Edgar. Although only 13 years old and probably illegitimate, Edward was the eldest of Edgar’s sons and was therefore chosen by the archbishop of Canterbury to be the next king. After a very brief reign, Edward was murdered by his step-mother, allowing his young step-brother Aethelred to succeed to the throne. Edward’s body was eventually buried at Shaftesbury nunnery; he quickly became venerated as a saint. From the late eleventh or early twelfth century, Edward became known as ‘the Martyr’.</p>

<h2>Elizabeth I</h2>
<p>Queen of England, 1558 – 1603. Daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. As princess, she became a focus for Protestant opposition during her half-sister Mary's reign and as such was briefly held prisoner in the Tower of London.

The document began with the phrase <em>hec est finalis concordia</em>, which means ‘this is the final concord’.

Many final concords are now held at The National Archives.</p>

<h2>Frankpledge, view of frankpledge</h2>
<p>System of law and order found in England from the 11th century. Men were organised into groups based on ten households, each responsible for the behaviour of its members. Each group had to attend a court held by their lord, called a view of frankpledge, to demonstrate that the system was working. As frankpledge only applied to the lower levels of society, knights, nobles and clergy were not included in the system.</p>

<h2>Gender</h2>
<p> All Latin nouns have a gender. There are three genders – masculine (for things that are male), feminine (for things that are female) and neuter (for things that are neither masculine nor feminine). Gender in grammar is not the same as gender in sex. In English, few nouns are given a gender, although we describe ships as ‘she’.</p>

<h2>Genitive</h2>

However, in 1067-68 she was involved in a rebellion against William I and subsequently left England for good.</p>

<h2>Harold</h2>
<p> King of England, 1066. Son of Godwin, earl of Wessex and Gytha. When Harold succeeded his father as Earl of Wessex in 1052, he became the most powerful English nobleman. His brother-in-law, King Edward, died childless in 1066 and nominated Harold as his successor. Harold was accepted as king by the English. However, William, Duke of Normandy, believed that he had been promised the throne and invaded England. Harold was killed at the battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066.</p>

In the 16th and 17th centuries and beyond, the term ‘knight’ was retained as a form of courtesy and status.

<h2>Probate</h2>
<p>Proving a will. Wills had to be proved in court - that is, the court had to be satisfied that the will truly reflected the last wishes of the deceased. Until the Court of Probate was established in 1858, ecclesiastical courts did the proving as wills were also seen as religious documents, in which the testator commended his soul to God.</p>

<h2>Pronoun</h2>
<p>Word that stands in for a noun. A pronoun gives a useful reminder of the person or thing being discussed, with its gender, number and case. Not all Latin pronouns have an equivalent in English and therefore they can take a while to understand. Always make sure you understand the function of each pronoun in its sentence.</p>

<h2>Prove, proved</h2>

Besides being a source of help and possibly of miracles themselves, saints were also a means of obtaining God’s help. Therefore they were an important focus for religious worship and had a major impact on everyday life in the medieval period. Each saint was said to have one or more attributes and had a particular day of the year designated to him or her. Parish churches were dedicated to one or more of the saints.</p>
