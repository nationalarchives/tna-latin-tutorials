<h1>Lesson 9: Subjunctive - part 3</h1>
<h2>Passive tenses</h2>
<h2>When you will encounter the subjunctive:</h2>

<ol type="1">
	
	<li><strong>Desires, wishes, proclamations</strong>
		<p>The most common use of the subjunctive is to express someone&rsquo;s hope for an action to occur, particularly if there is an element of uncertainty attached to that action.</p>
		<p>You will find this use throughout the documentation you look at, particularly in charters and deeds, where it often occurs at the beginning of the text.</p>
		<p>For example:</p>
		<p><em lang="la">Pateat universis…</em><br />Let it be known to all…</p>
		<p><em lang="la">Sciant presentes et future…</em><br />Know [men] present and future…</p>
		<p><em lang="la">Scias…</em><br />Know you…<br />(May you know that…)</p>
	</li>
	
	<li><strong>'Ut' and 'ne'</strong>
		<p>You will often notice <em lang="la">'ut'</em> and <em lang="la">'ne'</em> introducing a subjunctive clause.</p>
		
		
		<ol type="a">
			
			<li>One occasion where you will see this happening is when a subjunctive is used to express a command or order rather than an imperative. This is called the jussive subjunctive (from the verb <em lang="la">jubeo, jubere, jussi, jussum</em> (2) – to order). In this case, you will notice that <em lang="la">'ut'</em> introduces a positive command and <em lang="la">'ne'</em> introduces a negative one.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>For example:</p>
		<p><em lang="la">Preceptum est <strong>ut</strong> Adam commune habeat</em><br />It is ordered <strong>that</strong> Adam should have common land</p>
		<p><em lang="la">Preceptum est <strong>ne</strong> Adam commune habeat</em><br />It is ordered <strong>that</strong> Adam should <strong>not</strong> have common land</p>
		<p>A negative order or command can also be expressed using <em lang="la">'quod'</em> and <em lang="la">'nullus, -a, -um'</em> with the subjunctive.</p>
		<p>For example:</p>
		<p><em lang="la">Preceptum est <strong>quod</strong> Adam habeat <strong>nullum</strong> commune</em><br />
		It is ordered <strong>that</strong> Adam should have <strong>no</strong> common land</p>
		
		<ol type="a">
			<li>A second occasion where you will see this happening is when <em lang="la">'ut'</em> and <em lang="la">'ne'</em> are used to introduce purpose. Just as before, <em lang="la">'ut'</em> is used to indicate a positive purpose and <em lang="la">'ne'</em> a negative purpose.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>In this case, ‘<em lang="la">ut</em>’ is translated as ‘in order that’ or ‘so that’.</p>
		<p>For example:</p>
		<p><em lang="la">Et <strong>ut</strong> audiret communicacionem…</em><br />
		And <strong>in order that</strong> he might hear the communication…</p>
		<p>&lsquo;<em lang="la">Ne</em>&rsquo; is translated &lsquo;in order that…not&rsquo;, &lsquo;so that…not&rsquo;, &lsquo;lest, &lsquo;to avoid&rsquo;, &lsquo;to prevent&rsquo;.</p>
		<p><em lang="la">Et <strong>ne</strong> audiret communicacionem…</em><br />
		And <strong>in order that</strong> he might <strong>not</strong> hear the communication…<br />And <strong>so that</strong> he might <strong>not</strong> hear the communication…<br />And <strong>lest</strong> he might hear the communication…</p>
	</li>
	
	
	
	
	
	<li><strong>Conditions</strong><br />
		<p>You will encounter this use of the subjunctive frequently in wills and deeds, to express what should happen in the event of a death.</p>
		<p>One of the most common examples is:</p>
		<p><em lang="la">Si contingat…</em><br />If it should happen… </p>
		<p><em lang="la">contingo, contingere, contigi, contactum</em> (3) to happen, befall, come to pass</p>
	</li>
	
	<li><strong>After <em lang="la">'cum'</em>
		</strong>
		<p>The subjunctive often appears in clauses where <em lang="la">'cum'</em> means <em lang="la">'although'</em>, <em lang="la">'since'</em> or <em lang="la">'whereas'</em>.</p>
		<p>For example, in court rolls such a clause often appears in entries where a reference to an event at the previous court is included.</p>
		<p>For example:</p>
		<p><em lang="la"><strong>Cum</strong> Simo ad ultimam curiam <strong>apparuerit</strong>, ad istam curiam venit…</em><br />
			Whereas Simon appeared [literally 'he may have appeared'] at the last court, he has come to this court…<br />
			<em lang="la">Simo, Simonis</em> (m.) Simon<br />
		<em lang="la">appareo, apparere, apparui, apparitum</em> (2) to appear</p>
	</li>
	
	<li><p><strong>Concealed questions</strong></p>
	<p>You will probably encounter this in documents relating to inquiries, with a form of
	'An inquiry is to be held' + question word (when/where/if/whether/why/how etc.).</p>
	<p>For example:</p>
	<p><em lang="la">Lucia rogat pro inquisitione habenda si sit uxor Nicholai</em></p>
	<p>Lucy asks for an inquiry to be held [as to] whether she is the wife of Nicholas</p>
</li>
