<h1>Lesson 1: Imperfect tense - part 1 | 1 <a href="/latin/advanced/lesson01/part02.htm" title="link to part 2 of Lesson 1">2</a></h1>

<p>We recommend that you begin with lesson 1 and work through to lesson 12. Lesson 1 is the most simple; lesson 12 is the most difficult. You can work at your own pace. You should use the grammar tables, glossary and word list regularly to work through the activities and practice sentences. This will help you to become more familiar with the different constructs that you meet. </p>

<p>In <a href="/latin/beginners/default.htm" title="Link to the Beginners' Latin exhibition" >Beginners&rsquo; Latin</a> we looked at <a href="/latin/advanced/popup/definitions.htm#verb" title="View the definition of this term - this link opens in a new window" target="_blank"> verbs</a> in the <a href="/latin/advanced/popup/definitions.htm#presenttense" title="View the definition of this term - this link opens in a new window" target="_blank">present tense</a>.
</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div>Present tense</div>
<dl>
<dt lang="la">Ego Lucie nuntium do</dt>
<dd>I give a message to Lucy</dd>
</dl>
<div></div>

<p>We also looked at verbs in the <a href="/latin/advanced/popup/definitions.htm#pasttense" title="View the definition of this term - this link opens in a new window" target="_blank">past tense</a>
</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div>Past tense (perfect) </div>
<dl>
<dt lang="la">Ego Lucie nuntium dedi</dt>
<dd>I gave a message to Lucy</dd>
</dl>

<div></div>

<p>This kind of past tense is called a <a href="/latin/advanced/popup/definitions.htm#perfecttense" title="View the definition of this term - this link opens in a new window" target="_blank">perfect tense</a>. It is used to describe an action in the past which is completed. </p>

<p>To describe a past action or state which is incomplete, we use an imperfect tense. This tense indicates an action which has gone on over a period time or has happened frequently. It is translated into English by &lsquo;was/were&rsquo; + &lsquo;-ing&rsquo; or &lsquo;used to&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div>Past tense (imperfect) </div>
<dl>
<dt lang="la">Ego Lucie nuntium dabam</dt>
<dd>I was giving a message to Lucy</dd>
</dl>

<div></div>

<p>Just as with the present and perfect tenses, we need to know the <a href="/latin/advanced/popup/definitions.htm#conjugation" title="View the definition of this term - this link opens in a new window" target="_blank">conjugation</a> a verb belongs to in order to make an imperfect tense.
</p>

<div>
<h2>Remember</h2>
<p>Latin verbs are divided into four groups, or conjugations.</p>

<p>In each conjugation, the verbs share the same endings: <br />
An example of a first conjugation verb is: <em lang="la">confirmo, confirmare, confirmavi, confirmatum</em> (1) - to confirm.<br />
An example of a second conjugation verb is: <em lang="la">habeo, habere, habui, habitum</em> (2) - to have<br />
An example of a third conjugation verb is: <em lang="la">duco, ducere, duxi, ductum </em>(3) - to lead<br />
An example of a fourth conjugation verb is: <em lang="la">audio, audire, audivi, auditum</em> (4) - to hear
</p>
</div>

<p>The endings for the imperfect tense are similar to those of the present tense.</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th colspan="3">Present tense endings</th>

<th>Latin</th>
<th>English</th>
<th>&nbsp;</th>

<tr>
<td><em lang="la">-o</em></td>

<td><em lang="la">-tis</em></td>
<td>you</td>
<td>(second person plural)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em lang="la">-nt</em></td>
<td>they</td>
<td>(third person plural)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The difference is that they are preceded by &lsquo;<em lang="la">ba</em>-&rsquo; and, in the first person singular, the characteristic &lsquo;-<em lang="la">o</em>&rsquo; of the present changes to &lsquo;-<em lang="la">m</em>&rsquo; in the imperfect.		</p>
<p>For example:</p>

<tr>
<td><em lang="la">-ba<strong>tis</strong></em></td>
<td>you (plural)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em lang="la">-ba<strong>nt</strong></em></td>
<td>they</td>

</table>
<p>To form the imperfect tense, remove &lsquo;-<em lang="la">re</em>&rsquo; from the <a href="/latin/advanced/popup/definitions.htm#infinitive" title="View the definition of this term - this link opens in a new window" target="_blank">infinitive</a> form of the verb and add the relevant ending above. However, if the verb is in the fourth conjugation, you will need to add an &lsquo;-<em lang="la">e</em>&rsquo; before adding the relevant ending.		</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Imperfect tense of <em lang="la">do, <strong>da</strong>re, dedi, datum</em> (1)  to give</p>
<table>

<th>Latin</th>
