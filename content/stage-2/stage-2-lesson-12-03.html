<h1>Lesson 12: Infinitives; accusative and infinitive clause - part 3</h1>

<h2>Accusative and infinitive clause</h2>

<p>
	In the medieval documents you come across, you will frequently see the infinitive being used in conjunction with the accusative. This is called an accusative and infinitive clause, or an indirect statement, and is translated in a particular way.
</p>
<p>For example:</p>

<dl>
	<dt><em lang="la">Credo <strong>Johannem dedisse</strong> Matheo terram.</em></dt>
	<dd>I believe that John has given the land to Matthew.<br />
	(Literally - I believe John to have given to Matthew the land.)</dd>
</dl>
<div>
	<h2>Handy hint</h2>
	<p>You will often be able to spot an accusative and infinitive clause coming up from the type of verb which precedes it.</p>
	<p>For example:</p>
	
	<table summary="Table showing a present passive translation">
		<tr>
			<td>to hear</td>
			<td>audio, audire, audivi, auditum (4)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>to say</td>
			<td>dico, dicere, dixi, dictum (3)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>to think</td>
			<td>puto, putare, putavi, putatum (1)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>to believe</td>
			<td>credo, credere, credidi, creditum (3)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>to know </td>
			<td>scio, scire, scivi, scitum (4)</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
