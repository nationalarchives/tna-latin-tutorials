<h1>Lesson 11: Gerunds and Gerundives - part 1</h1>

<h2>Gerundive</h2>

<p>A gerundive is what is called a verbal adjective. This means that it occupies a middle ground between a verb and an <a href="/latin/advanced/popup/definitions.htm#adjective" title="View the definition of this term - this link opens in a new window" target="_blank">adjective</a> and shows characteristics of both. It is <a href="/latin/advanced/popup/definitions.htm#passivevoice" title="View the definition of this term - this link opens in a new window" target="_blank">passive</a> in meaning and exists in both the singular and plural form.

<p>The gerundive has the same endings as a Group 1 and 2 adjective, such as <a href="/latin/advanced/popup//grammar-table.htm#bonus" title="View this term in the Grammar table - this link opens in a new window" target="_blank"><em lang="la">&lsquo;bonus, -a, -um&rsquo;</em><img src="/images/latin/advanced/icons/icon-grammar-sm.gif" alt="View this term in the Grammar table - this link opens in a new window" /></a>, and is usually translated into English with the words &lsquo;to be&rsquo; followed by the <a href="/latin/advanced/popup/definitions.htm#pastparticiple" title="View the definition of this term - this link opens in a new window" target="_blank">past participle</a>.

<h2>Handy hint</h2>
<p>It is important to note that the gerundive does not have an exact translation into English, and in order to convey the idea of obligation or suitability inherent in its meaning, translations can include such forms as 'fit to be', 'must be' and 'ought to be'.
</p>

<h2>Uses of the gerundive</h2>

<p><strong>(1)</strong>  One of the most common uses of the gerundive in medieval documents is the phrase <em lang="la">'habendum et tenendum'</em>, which you may well come across abbreviated to <em lang="la">'habend et tenend'</em>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p><em lang="la">Dedit messuagium habendum et tenendum Barnabe</em><br />
He gave the messuage to be had and to be held to Barnabas</p>
<p>Or in a more recognisable construction:</p>

<p>He gave the messuage to have and to hold to Barnabas</p>

<p><strong>(2)</strong> It is often used with the verb <em lang="la">'esse'</em> to convey necessity or obligation.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p><em lang="la">Cultura danda est</em><br />The furlong must be/should be/ought to be given</p>
<div>
<h2>Handy hint</h2>
<p>You will notice examples of Latin gerundives still in use in modern English today.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Amanda &ndash; (a girl) fit to be loved<br />
Miranda &ndash; (a girl) fit to be admired<br />
Memoranda &ndash; things to be remembered<br />
Agenda &ndash; things to be done</p>
