    <dl>
        <dt><a name="ablativeabsolute" id="ablativeabsolute"></a>Ablative absolute</dt>
        <dd>A phrase which is independent of any grammatical constraints of the main sentence which it is linked to, and contains a participle in the ablative case.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt><a name="ablativeofcomparison" id="ablativeofcomparison"></a>Ablative of comparison</dt>
        <dd>Sometimes the ablative form of a noun or pronoun is used in sentences to denote comparison instead of the word <em class="latin" lang="la">&lsquo;quam&rsquo;</em>.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt><a name="activevoice" id="activevoice"></a>Active voice</dt>
        <dd>This is the form of the verb we use when someone or something has carried out an action. We use this voice to say what the subject does.<br /><br />
            For example: <em class="latin" lang="la">Cartam confirmat</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He confirms the charter. </dd>
    </dl>


    <dl>
        <dt><a name="accusativeandinfinitiveclause" id="accusativeandinfinitiveclause"></a>Accusative and infinitive clause</dt>
        <dd>A clause that appears after the main verb, which uses a noun in the accusative and the infinitive form of the verb in its construction, such as in the sentence &lsquo;he said that he would perform the service&rsquo;. This is called an indirect statement in English.<br />
            <br />
            For example: <em class="latin" lang="la">Credo <strong>Johannem dedisse</strong> Matheo terram</em>. (Literally - I believe John to have given to Matthew the land.) I believe that John has given the land to Matthew.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt><a name="adjective" id="adjective"></a>Adjective </dt>
        <dd>An adjective is the type of word which we use to describe a noun.<br />
            <br />
            For example: A <strong>handsome</strong> man</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt><a name="adverb" id="adverb"></a>Adverb</dt>
        <dd>An adverb is the type of word which we use to describe a verb.<br />
            <br />For example: He ran <strong>quickly</strong>.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt><a name="case" id="case"></a>Case</dt>
        <dd>A case is the particular form a noun, adjective or pronoun takes, that shows its relationship with other words in the sentence. There are six cases in Latin - the nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive, dative and ablative - and these exist in the singular and plural.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt><a name="comparative" id="comparative"></a>Comparative</dt>
        <dd>When we compare two things, we use the comparative form of an adjective to express which person or thing has a greater or lesser property or quality than the other. <br />
            <br />
            For example: He is <strong>taller</strong> than her.<br />
            <br />


            When we compare two actions or states, we use the comparative form of an adverb to express which action or state has a greater or lesser property or quality than the other.<br />
            <br />


            For example: He ran more <strong>quickly</strong>.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt><a name="complement" id="complement"></a>Complement</dt>
        <dd>In the majority of sentences you will find a subject and an object. However, sometimes you will come across a sentence which contains no object such as this:<br />
            <br />
            <strong>He<sup>1</sup></strong> is the new <strong>farmer<sup>2</sup></strong><br />
            <br />

            <sup>1</sup>Subject (Nominative)<br />
            <sup>2</sup>Complement (Nominative)<br />
            <br />
            In this case, &lsquo;he&rsquo; is the subject and &lsquo;farmer&rsquo; is the complement. &lsquo;Farmer&rsquo; is an extra piece of information about &lsquo;he&rsquo;, thus both subject and complement appear in the nominative case.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt><a name="compoundverbs" id="compoundverbs"></a>Compound verbs</dt>
        <dd>In Latin, prepositions can be added to the beginning of simple verbs in order to modify their meaning.<br />
            <br />
            For example: <em class="latin" lang="la"><strong>ab</strong>sum, <strong>ab</strong>esse, <strong>a</strong>fui</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be away from, absent, lacking</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt><a name="conjugation" id="conjugation"></a>Conjugation</dt>
        <dd>Latin verbs are divided into four groups, or conjugations. In each conjugation, the verbs share the same endings.<br />

            An example of a first conjugation verb is: <em class="latin" lang="la">confirmo, confirmare, confirmavi, confirmatum</em> (1)  to confirm.<br />

            An example of a second conjugation verb is: <em class="latin" lang="la">habeo, habere, habui, habitum</em> (2)  to have.<br />

            An example of a third conjugation verb is: <em class="latin" lang="la">duco, ducere, duxi, ductum</em> (3) to lead.<br />

            An example of a fourth conjugation verb is: <em class="latin" lang="la">audio, audire, audivi, auditum</em> (4)  to hear.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt><a name="dativeofpossession" id="dativeofpossession"></a>Dative of possession</dt>
        <dd>Sometimes in a sentence such as &lsquo;John is the son of William&rsquo; the dative case is used to translate &lsquo;of William&rsquo; instead of the genitive.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt><a name="declension" id="declension"></a>Declension</dt>
        <dd>Latin nouns are divided into five groups called declensions.  In each declension, the nouns share the same endings. A declension is usually defined by its ending in the nominative singular.  For example, nouns in the first declension end &lsquo;-<em lang="la">a</em>&rsquo; in the nominative singular. If a declension has a variety of forms in the nominative singular, it will be defined by its endings in the genitive singular. For example, nouns in the third declension end &lsquo;-<em lang="la">is</em>&rsquo; in the genitive singular. </dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt><a name="demonstrativeadjective" id="demonstrativeadjective"></a>Demonstrative adjective</dt>
        <dd>Demonstrative adjectives include &lsquo;this&rsquo;, &lsquo;these&rsquo;, &lsquo;that&rsquo; and &lsquo;those&rsquo; and are used to identify a particular noun or noun phrase. <br />
            <br />
            For example: I gave <strong>these</strong> sweets to <strong>that</strong> boy.</dd>
    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt><a name="deponentverb" id="deponentverb"></a>Deponent verb</dt>
        <dd>When a Latin verb is passive in form, but has an active meaning, it is called a deponent verb.<br />
            <br />
            For example: <em class="latin" lang="la">sequor, sequi, secutus sum</em> (3) means &lsquo;to follow&rsquo; and not &lsquo;to be followed&rsquo;.</dd>

    </dl>

    <dl>
        <dt><a name="infinitive" id="infinitive"></a>Infinitive</dt>
        <dd>The infinitive form of a verb is that which has no inflection to indicate person or number. In English the infinitive of a verb begins &lsquo;to …&rsquo;. To make other forms of a verb it is important to know the present infinitive of verbs, which is listed second in a dictionary, with the ending &lsquo;-<em lang="la">are</em>&rsquo;, &lsquo;-<em lang="la">ere</em>&rsquo; or &lsquo;-<em  lang="la">ire</em>&rsquo;. <br />
            <br />

            <br />

        <dd>Three moods of a verb exist in Latin. <br />
            <br />
            The <strong>indicative</strong> mood expresses facts. <br />

            The <strong>imperative</strong> mood expresses commands.<br />

            The <strong>subjunctive</strong> expresses an element of uncertainty, often a wish, desire, doubt or hope.<br />
            <br />
            For example:<br />
